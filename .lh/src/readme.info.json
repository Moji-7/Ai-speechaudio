            "content": "Coding Task: React App with SSML\r\nIn this task, you will build a React app that uses SSML (Speech Synthesis Markup Language) to generate speech from text. SSML is a standard way to control the pronunciation, intonation, and other aspects of speech synthesis. You can learn more about SSML from the Google Cloud Text-to-Speech documentation.\r\n\r\nYour app should have the following features:\r\n\r\nFetch an API that provides some text content, such as news articles, blog posts, or stories.\r\nParse the text content into sentences and add SSML tags to modify the speech output. For example, you can use the <break> tag to insert pauses, the <emphasis> tag to stress certain words, or the <say-as> tag to change how numbers or dates are pronounced.\r\nSet up a speech engine or build a custom hook that uses the Google Cloud Text-to-Speech API to convert the SSML text into speech. You will need to create a Google Cloud account and enable the Text-to-Speech API to get an API key.\r\nCreate a UI that allows the user to play, pause, and load more content. You can use the react-speech-kit library to simplify the UI and speech functionality.\r\nThis is an assignment in both React and TypeScript. You should use TypeScript to type your props, hooks, and components. You should also follow the [React TypeScript Cheatsheet] for best practices and tips.\r\n\r\nThere are tests already created and we will be running them to evaluate your solution. Good luck! üçÄ"
